# CodeClauseInternship_SpeechEmotionRecognition
This repository contains the code and resources for a Speech Emotion Recognition project developed during an internship at CodeClause. The project focuses on analyzing and recognizing emotions from speech using machine learning techniques.


Overview:

The Speech Emotion Recognition project aims to detect and classify emotions expressed in speech using advanced data science methodologies. The dataset utilized for this project is the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) obtained from Kaggle. TESS comprises a collection of audio files labeled with various emotional states.
Project Components

1. Dataset Preparation:

The dataset preprocessing involved: (Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess/)

    Exploring the TESS dataset
    Cleaning and organizing audio files
    Feature extraction from audio signals (such as MFCC, spectral features, etc.)
